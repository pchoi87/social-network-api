# Social Network API

## Description

This project is a Social Network API built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The application allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The API is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently, making it suitable for a social media platform.
